# KARTGAME

## What is KARTGAME?
KARTGAME is an in-development kart racer with a style inspired by Super Mario Kart. The point of this project was to see if I could effectively re-create the way that the tracks are rendered in Super Mario Kart, since I find that style very charming.

## How do I build KARTGAME?
There are built in .bat/.sh files for Windows & *nix/macOS respectively.
If you would like to build yourself, the commands are:
`cmake -S . -B build`
`cmake --build build`
